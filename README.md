Welcome to the Fall 2021 Team 1 Github Repository

### Instructions
Use the arrow keys to move the player character around the screen. The Z key interacts with the world, such as talking to NPC's or picking up items. The X key spawns an enemy to the screen (Alpha only). The spacebar allows the player to attack.

### Work Completed
Gameplay: Basic gameplay is working, the player can move around the screen, interact with NPC's or items, and attack and kill enemies. The game screen is finished as well, it displays the appropriate amount of hearts for the player's health as well as the current score and current location. Enemies currently have barebones implementation, can be spawned in killed only. NPC's work as intended.


Serialization:


High Score Screen: High score screen currently still in progress. The title screen and about screen are finished.


### Known Issues
Major bug is thrown when the player kills an enemy. This is linked to the fact that there is currently two different timers running in the program. By beta, the two timers will be merged to eliminate the bug.
